## Renewable Energy Mix Predictor Model

### Background

The generation of electricity produces 37.8 gigatonnes of co2 per year! It is therefore vital that we understand what drives the adoption of renewable energy technologies over time.

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model which forecasts the change in a country's electricity generation from renewable sources (as a percentage of its overall electricity generation) over time.

### Methodology

The model utilises a collection of economic and social datapoints collected from various supranational public bodies such as the World Bank and IMF.

### Key Findings and Potential Improvements

A Random Forest Regressor model is adopted in this instance, however it falls short on both accuracy scores (Root Mean Squared Error) and statistical significant (p-values).

The model could be improved by utilising a larger dataset spanning a longer period of time. Further, more feature variables (which capture political and/or environmental factors) could be utilised to enhance the model's capabilities.

Whilst improvements can certainly be made, this model represents a useful first step in understanding what truly drives renewable technology adoption.
